# 🌍 CarbonScope: Global CO₂ Emissions Dashboard

An interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard designed to visualize global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions across countries and years. This project helps users analyze emission trends, compare nations on total and per capita emissions, and explore the environmental impact of global industrial and population growth.



## 🧭 Project Overview

The **CarbonScope Dashboard** provides a user-friendly platform to understand and interpret CO₂ emission data from around the world. Built by **Manu Tyagi**, this report focuses on helping researchers, policy analysts, educators, and environmentally conscious individuals gain actionable insights into emission patterns over time.



## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

The dashboard was developed using the following technologies:

- **Power BI Desktop** – Primary platform for building the dashboard.
- **Power Query** – For transforming, cleaning, and reshaping the raw dataset.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used to build dynamic calculations, KPIs, and conditional logic.
- **Data Modeling** – Structured relationships between tables to allow filtering, aggregation, and drill-down features.
- **.pbix Format** – Native file format used for Power BI development and sharing.

## 📚 Data Source

- **Source**: [Our World in Data – CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions)
- **Description**:
  - Global dataset on annual CO₂ emissions by country
  - Includes metrics such as CO₂ per capita, population, and GDP
  - Covers data for 190+ countries from 1960 to the latest available year
  - Emissions are measured in metric tons (MtCO₂)



## 🔍 Problem Statement

As climate change becomes increasingly urgent, understanding country-level emissions data is critical for effective policy-making, investment strategies, and educational outreach. However, raw data is often difficult to interpret and lacks interactivity, making it inaccessible for most users.



## 🎯 Objective

To build an interactive, clean, and insightful dashboard that:
- Illustrates total and per capita CO₂ emissions globally
- Highlights high-emitting countries and trends over time
- Enables year-based filtering and comparative analysis
- Supports data-driven decision-making related to climate action
